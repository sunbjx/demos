/**
 * The Tracer class is the primary way for instrumentation code (note user code) to
 * interact with the library. It provides methods to create and manipulate spans.
 * <p>
 *
 * A 'span' represents a length of time. It has many other attributes such as a name, ID,
 * and even potentially a set of key/value strings attached to it.
 * <p>
 *
 * Each thread in your application has a single currently active currentSpan associated
 * with it. When this is non-null, it represents the current operation that the thread is
 * doing. spans are NOT thread-safe, and must never be used by multiple threads at once.
 * With care, it is possible to safely pass a span object between threads, but in most
 * cases this is not necessary.
 * <p>
 *
 * Most crucial methods in terms of span lifecycle are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@linkplain Tracer#createSpan(String) createSpan} method in this class
 * starts a new span.</li>
 * <li>The {@linkplain Tracer#createSpan(String, Span) createSpan} method creates a new span
 * which has this thread's currentSpan as one of its parents</li>
 * <li>The {@linkplain Tracer#continueSpan(Span) continueSpan} method creates a
 * new instance of span that logically is a continuation of the provided span.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Closing a TraceScope does a few things:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It closes the span which the scope was managing.</li>
 * <li>Set currentSpan to the previous currentSpan (which may be null).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
